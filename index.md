## About
Hi, I’m **Jayden Jung**, a student at **Brea Olinda High School** in California.  
I’m interested in **AI-driven economy**, **game theory**, and **multi-agent learning**, especially how cooperation and competition (co-opetition) emerge when agents learn over time.

## Current Focus
- Replicator-guided warm-start reinforcement learning for faster convergence to game-theoretic equilibria  
- Modeling research collaboration as a co-opetition system using public consortium participation data  
- Building clean, reproducible simulation pipelines and evaluation metrics

## Featured Project
**Replicator-Guided Warm-Start for Co-opetition Learning**  
I combine evolutionary game theory (replicator dynamics) with multi-agent reinforcement learning to show that two learning processes can converge to the same equilibrium, but with very different convergence speeds depending on initialization.
